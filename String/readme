Assignment number: 2
Is it possible for StrCopy to call assert to verify that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large enough? Explain.
No. Since we use the pointer, we have no way to check the memory occupied by the pointer. 
It can also have data cleared to 0, but not the string ending Null character, making null checking not reliable.
If the destination memory is too small, most likely the buffer overflow happens.

I use 1 free late day for this assignment.
Part 1 was implemented based on Pointer notation only.
