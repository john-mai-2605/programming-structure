Assignment number: 4

I use 1 late day.
Reference: Assignment document, C documentation, gcc documentation, Assembly documentation
I also refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30559296/diff-command-in-bash to make a bash file to automatically test my code.
To run, simply "bash test.sh"
For invalid input starting with "_", it will be intepreted as 0 (consistent with atoi functionality).
