Array implementation save memory (only need to save the actual information) but has high time complexity.
Frequent reqistration and unregisteration creates many holes (empty elements) scattered across the array.

Hash table implementation waste some more memory (the array for hash index and the link between elements) 
but has better time performance. There are more overhead (hashing) and might be sensitive to collisions

Detail comparison:
complexity          Space (memory)          Create              Insertion (unique)  Deletion                Search              Destroy
Array               O(N)                    O(1)                O(N)                O(N)                    O(N)                O(N)
Hash table          O(N)                    O(1)                O(N/bucketsize)     O(N/bucketsize)         O(N/bucketsize)     O(N)
(with big bucketsize, O(N/bucketsize) ~ O(1))

I implement hash table expansion in RegisterCustomer function
I use 1 late day.
